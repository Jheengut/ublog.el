You can get the buffer associated with this process using

The optional HEADERS are an alist where each element has the form
\(NAME . VALUE).  Both must be strings and will be passed along with
the request.

With optional argument SENTINEL, the buffer is not shown.  It is the
responsibility of the sentinel to show it, if appropriate.  A sentinel
function takes two arguments, process and message.  It is called when
the process is killed, for example.  This is useful when specifying a
non-persistent connection.  By default, connections are persistent.
Add \(\"Connection\" . \"close\") to HEADERS in order to specify a
non-persistent connection.  Usually you do not need to specify a
sentinel, and `ignore' is used instead, to prevent a message being
printed when the connection is closed.

If you want to filter the content as it arrives, bind
`http-filter-pre-insert-hook' and `http-filter-post-insert-hook'.

The optional argument VERSION specifies the HTTP version to use.  It
defaults to version 1.0, such that the connection is automatically
closed when the entire document has been downloaded.  This will then
call SENTINEL, if provided.  If no sentinel is provided, `ignore' will
be used in order to prevent a message in the buffer when the process
is killed.

CONTENT-TYPE is a coding system to use for the encoding of the url
param value.  Its upper case print name will be used for the server.
Possible values are `iso-8859-1' or `euc-jp' and others.

The coding system of the process is set to `binary', because we need to
distinguish between \\r and \\n.  To correctly decode the text later,
use `decode-coding-region' and get the coding system to use from
`http-headers'."

PARAMETERS is an alist of parameters to use.  Each element has the
form \(NAME . VALUE).  These usually correspond to successful controls
on HTML forms.

CONTENT-TYPE is a coding system to use.  Its upper case print name
will be used for the server.  Possible values are `iso-8859-1' or
`euc-jp' and others.

The optional HEADERS are an alist where each element has the form
\(NAME . VALUE).  Both must be strings and will be passed along with
the request.  The reason CONTENT-TYPE is not just passed along as one
of the headers is that part of the Content-Type value is fixed and
cannot be changed: The basic encoding is implemented using
`html-url-encode' and is called application/x-www-form-urlencoded.

With optional argument SENTINEL, the buffer is not shown.  It is the
responsibility of the sentinel to show it, if appropriate.  A sentinel
function takes two arguments, process and message.  It is called when
the process is killed, for example.  This is useful when specifying a
non-persistent connection.  By default, connections are persistent.
Add \(\"Connection\" . \"close\") to HEADERS in order to specify a
non-persistent connection.  Usually you do not need to specify a
sentinel, and `ignore' is used instead, to prevent a message being
printed when the connection is closed.

If you want to filter the content as it arrives, bind
`http-filter-pre-insert-hook' and `http-filter-post-insert-hook'.

The optional argument VERSION specifies the HTTP version to use.  It
defaults to version 1.0, such that the connection is automatically
closed when the entire document has been downloaded.

If the optional argument VERBOSE is non-nil, a message will show the
command sent to the server.

The coding system of the process is set to `binary', because we need to
distinguish between \\r and \\n.  To correctly decode the text later,
use `decode-coding-region' and get the coding system to use from
