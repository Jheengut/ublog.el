* Structure
** twapi.el for standard Twitter API interfaces: Need to complete
** twsuperapi.el for additional interfaces: New ideas go here. Document well!
** twhttp.el handles all HTTP communication- Most of it is ripped out from http-get.el and http-post.el
** rewrite.el that binds together everything. Will be renamed later
** twhelper.el for all commonly used misc macros. Will probably get rid of this later
* The TODO priority list
** Clean up and streamline the HTTP GET and POST interfaces in twhttp.el
*** Rip out similar code from other files such as rewrite.el
*** Drop http-cookies.el: Let's just use OAuth
** Finish off twapi.el for the standard Twitter API interfaces
** Write in authentication into rewrite.el using OAuth from twapi.el
*** Finish this off asap for premature testing to work
** Dump new ideas into twsuperapi.el
