#+TODO: TODO IN-PROGRESS STUCK DEFERRED | DONE INVALID ABANDONED

* Structure and file layout
** twapi.el for standard Twitter API interfaces: Need to complete
** twsuperapi.el for additional interfaces: New ideas go here. Document well!
** twhttp.el handles all HTTP communication- Most of it is ripped out from http-get.el and http-post.el
** rewrite.el that binds together everything. Will be renamed later
** twhelper.el for all commonly used misc macros. Will probably get rid of this later
** oauth.el lifted from psanford's repo. Try not to edit
** hmc-sha1 lifted from Derek Upham's repo. No need to edit
** parse-twresponse.el contains code to map json response to user variables. Needs lots of work
** twminors.el contains ideas for minor modes. Very long term goal - ?
