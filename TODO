#+TODO: TODO IN-PROGRESS STUCK DEFERRED | DONE INVALID ABANDONED

* Structure and file layout
** twapi.el for standard Twitter API interfaces: Need to complete
** twsuperapi.el for extra API interfaces. New ideas go here. Document well!
** twui.el is the code for all user interfaces. All display-related functions and keybindings go here.
** rewrite.el that binds together everything. Will be renamed later
** twhelper.el for all commonly used misc macros. Will probably get rid of this later
** oauth.el lifted from psanford's repo and heavily edited. Used for all HTTP communicated.
** hmc-sha1.el lifted from Derek Upham's repo. Unmodified
** twparse.el contains code to map json response to user variables. Needs lots of work
** twminors.el contains ideas for minor modes. Very long term goal - ?
